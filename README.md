In English, here are the conditions for use:

- You *cannot* sell this product, or any revised versions of this product.
- You *can* modify a ["forked"](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) version of this product.
- You *cannot* distribute this product, or any modified versions of this product.
- You *can* modify this product and submit it to an academic institution, so long as you're following your institutions academic guidelines and procedures.
- You *cannot* create content of modified versions without specifying (in an easy to see location) in the created content that said content is based on a modified version.
- You *can* view the code for academic purposes.

The above license applies to everything seen in this repository that was created by any of the contributors of this repository.  

Any models added to the repository that were created by third-party vendors have their own licensing, which should be considered.  

Created vs added:  

- Added refers to the addition of the file to the repository
- Created refers to construction of a file by a contributor (which may or may not be added to the repository)

Content includes but is not limited to:

- Monetized, and non-monetized, published videos
- Images
- Written text in posts on social media

What we're hoping to accomplish with all of this:

- The opportunity to see how a game is made, everything within it, and what methods/approaches were used to create such.
- Reduce fake content published online about the game (as we're handing you the source code and letting you modify it, it's incredibly easy to create fake content and indirectly claim it's the "real" version to gain more "views")
- Ensure bootleg versions aren't being sold and/or distributed (we've poured a lot of time and heart into the game, for others to make a profit off of our work just by distributing it **isn't** something we're comfortable with.)

## Key High-Level Functionalities (KHLF)

### RPG

The world will feel the same as Earth. There will be the same animals, only humans, but there will be small things you occasionally find... Maybe a rock with some writing chiseled into it... You interact with it and you're bleeding, maybe you die, maybe you find a way to stop the bleeding and find yourself able to summon a sword made of blood. 

Ultimately, this is a game of discovery. Not the happy go-lucky kind, like Minecraft. This is the kind where you're miserable in the rain, but still wanting to persist in it just so that you can learn more.

### Dark Fantasy

Plants, animals, etc will be Earth-similar/existing only. The discovery and awe should come from exploration and curiosity rather than the graphics.  

The fantasy comes into play through sorcery. I like the word sorcery more than magic, as to me it plays into a more scientific approach: Given inputs, an output is produced. Magic seems to come from nowhere. The sorcery in this game is volatile; some spells are easy to understand, some are difficult and dangerous (both in output, and if you mess up).  

### Open World

Zero procedural generation, but quest lines will become available (or blocked) depending on what quests you fulfill (and even what quests you deny).  

### Survival

I'm not sure about the food or water. The whole "survival" aspect has the least of my confidence.
