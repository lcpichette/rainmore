# Rainmore

An RPG dark fantasy open-world first-person survival game.

## Key High-Level Functionalities (KHLF)

### RPG

The world will feel the same as Earth. There will be the same animals, only humans, but there will be small things you occassionally find... Maybe a rock with some writing chiseled into it... You interact with it and you're bleeding, maybe you die, maybe you find a way to stop the bleeding and find yourself able to summon a sword made of blood. 

Ultimately, this is a game of discovery. Not the happy go-lucky kind, like Minecraft. This is the kind where you're miserable in the rain, but still wanting to persist in it just so that you can learn more.

### Dark Fantasy

Plants, animals, etc will be Earth-similar/existing only. The discovery and awe should come from exploration and curiosity rather than the graphics.  

The fantasy comes into play through sorcery. I like the word sorcery more than magic, as to me it plays into a more scientific approach: Given inputs, an output is produced. Magic seems to come from nowhere. The sorcery in this game is volatile; some spells are easy to understand, some are difficult and dangerous (both in output, and if you mess up).  

### Open World

Zero procedural generation, but quest lines will become available (or blocked) depending on what quests you fulfill (and even what quests you deny).
